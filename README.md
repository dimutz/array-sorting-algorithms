# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays
We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

The Radix Sort algorithm sorts the array.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
